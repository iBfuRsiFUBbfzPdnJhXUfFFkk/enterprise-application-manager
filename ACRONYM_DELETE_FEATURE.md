# Acronym Delete Feature

The ability to delete acronyms has been added to the application with confirmation dialogs and proper safety measures.

## Features

### Delete from Detail Page
- **Red "Delete" button** next to the Edit button in the header
- **Confirmation dialog** displays:
  - Acronym abbreviation
  - Full name
  - Warning that action cannot be undone
- **Safe operation**: Deletion only occurs after user confirmation

### Delete from List Page
- **"Delete" link** in the Actions column (red text)
- Same confirmation dialog as detail page
- Convenient for bulk operations when reviewing the list

### Confirmation Dialog
Both deletion methods show a JavaScript confirmation with:
```
Are you sure you want to delete this acronym?

Acronym: [ACRONYM]
Name: [FULL NAME]

This action cannot be undone.
```

## Implementation

### Files Created
1. **`core/views/acronym/acronym_delete_view.py`**
   - Uses the generic delete view
   - Redirects to acronym list after successful deletion
   - Handles non-existent acronyms with 500 error

### Files Modified

1. **`core/urls/urlpatterns_acronym.py`**
   - Added route: `acronym/delete/<int:model_id>/`
   - URL name: `acronym_delete`

2. **`templates/authenticated/acronym/acronym_detail.html`**
   - Added red Delete button with trash icon
   - Added JavaScript confirmation function
   - Button positioned next to Edit button

3. **`templates/authenticated/acronym/acronym.html`**
   - Added "Delete" link in Actions column
   - Added JavaScript confirmation function
   - Red styling for delete link

## URL Structure

- **Delete URL**: `/authenticated/acronym/delete/<id>/`
- **Method**: GET (triggers immediate deletion after confirmation)
- **Redirect**: Returns to `/authenticated/acronym/` after deletion

## User Flow

### From Detail Page
1. User views acronym detail page
2. Clicks red "Delete" button
3. Confirmation dialog appears
4. User clicks "OK" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort
5. If confirmed, acronym is deleted and user redirected to list

### From List Page
1. User views acronym list
2. Clicks "Delete" link in Actions column
3. Confirmation dialog appears
4. User clicks "OK" to confirm or "Cancel" to abort
5. If confirmed, acronym is deleted and page reloads

## Safety Features

### Confirmation Required
- JavaScript confirmation prevents accidental deletions
- Shows acronym details in confirmation message
- Clear warning that action cannot be undone

### Error Handling
- Non-existent acronyms return 500 error page
- Generic delete view handles database errors gracefully

### UI Feedback
- Red color coding clearly indicates destructive action
- Trash icon provides visual cue
- Positioned separately from Edit button to prevent misclicks

## Code Details

### Delete View
```python
def acronym_delete_view(request: HttpRequest, model_id: int) -> HttpResponse:
    return generic_delete_view(
        model_cls=Acronym,
        model_id=model_id,
        request=request,
        success_route='acronym',
    )
```

### JavaScript Confirmation (Detail Page)
```javascript
function confirmDelete() {
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this acronym?\n\n' +
                'Acronym: {{ model.acronym|escapejs }}\n' +
                'Name: {{ model.name|escapejs }}\n\n' +
                'This action cannot be undone.')) {
        window.location.href = "{% url 'acronym_delete' model_id=model.id %}";
    }
}
```

### JavaScript Confirmation (List Page)
```javascript
function confirmDelete(id, acronym, name) {
    if (confirm('Are you sure you want to delete this acronym?\n\n' +
                'Acronym: ' + acronym + '\n' +
                'Name: ' + name + '\n\n' +
                'This action cannot be undone.')) {
        window.location.href = "{% url 'acronym_delete' model_id=0 %}".replace('0', id);
    }
}
```

## Testing

To test deletion:

1. **Create a test acronym**:
   ```python
   from core.models.acronym import Acronym
   test = Acronym.objects.create(
       acronym="TEST",
       name="Test Acronym"
   )
   ```

2. **Navigate to list page** and verify Delete link appears
3. **Click Delete** and verify confirmation dialog
4. **Cancel** and verify acronym still exists
5. **Click Delete again** and confirm
6. **Verify** acronym is removed from list

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- Requires user to be authenticated (inherited from base views)
- No additional authorization checks
- Immediate deletion on confirmation

### Potential Enhancements
- Add permission checks (only admins can delete)
- Implement soft deletes (mark as inactive instead of removing)
- Add audit logging for deletion actions
- Require additional authentication for critical deletions
- Implement "undo" functionality with temporary holding period

## Styling

### Delete Button (Detail Page)
- Background: `bg-red-600`
- Hover: `bg-red-700`
- Focus ring: `ring-red-500`
- Icon: Trash can SVG

### Delete Link (List Page)
- Text color: `text-red-600`
- Hover: `text-red-900`
- Consistent with Edit/View link styling

## Browser Compatibility

The confirmation dialog uses the standard JavaScript `confirm()` function, which is supported by all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Edge: ✓
- Firefox: ✓
- Safari: ✓
- Mobile browsers: ✓

## Future Improvements

1. **Soft Delete**: Mark as deleted instead of removing from database
2. **Batch Delete**: Select multiple acronyms and delete at once
3. **Undo Feature**: Brief window to undo deletion
4. **Audit Trail**: Log who deleted what and when
5. **Permission Checks**: Restrict deletion to specific user roles
6. **Related Data Warning**: Show if acronym is referenced elsewhere
7. **AJAX Delete**: Delete without page reload
8. **Toast Notifications**: Success/error messages after deletion
